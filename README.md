## Project Title

**Software used:** 
- Laravel for backend development and backoffice. 
- React native for the frontend application. 

**setup the backend (laravel homestead) development**
I've had some difficulties while setting up the backend development environnement. The Laravel installation itself was easy and well documented on there site. Setting up the virsual machine with homestead was a bit more difficult. This is where the problems occured. Even though, after a good decent search and some tutorial i managed to get everything up and running.

## Project Title

**Software used:** 
- Laravel for backend development and backoffice. 
- React native for the frontend application. 

**Backend development** 
I've added the first database migration. I've discovered that there is no such thing as ordering the migrations when running them. So every time you want to add e.g. a foreign key. You'll have to make a new migration or edit the timestamp of the current file you are working in.
